- why do i have added a manifest link in this commit
- rm class="select" from slecet input and name proptery
- update sage-ui version and fix label var
- eg edit input on the left side, which is mapped to user and reactively updates userDto on the right side
- demonstrate the css importing for custom component styling
- demonstrate passing a complex service, which is holding state (e.g translationService), from one view to another using the mapper
